    <h2>Rationelle</h2>
    <p class="Rationelle">
        In a world increasingly-connected by the Internet, the World Wide Web has emerged as a nearly-ubiquitous platform for personal
        communication, business operations, and global information sharing.
        <br>
        <br> Any student of a technological field-and especially students of computer science/engineering-would be well-served
        by developing an understanding of the web and a proficiency in creation of the applications that it enables.

    </p>

    <h2>Format and Procedures</h2>
    <hr>
    <p name="Format and Procedures">
        This course meets once per week for a 3.5-hour period without an additional lab component. This course is intended to reflect
        industry norms as much as possible; to that end, project delivery and collaboration are emphasized over attendance
        and summative assessment.
    </p>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>

    <p name="Assumptions">
        This course has no prerequisite courses; however, students are expected to be proficient in general programming principles
        and able to code in at least one language. Such experience will ensure that students are able to expediently learn
        new programming languages as they are introduced in this course.
        <br>
        <br> No web development experience is required; this course assumes that students do not have any prior knowledge of
        the subject matter.
        <br>
        <br> Note that this is not a web design course. Presentation is covered and general design tools will be discussed, but
        the emphasis is on application programming using the web as a platform.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p name="Academic Integrity">
            This course observed and upholds the [|Needs to be link||CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity (Accessible Plain Text)|||]. Each
            student in this course is expected to abide by this policy. Any work submitted by a student in this course for
            academic credit will be the student's own work. Collaboration is allowed where assignments are designated as
            group projects. You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture
            and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such
            students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy
            of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette,
            or a hard copy. Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who
            gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of
            this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action. During examinations,
            you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare
            papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will
            result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
        </p>
        <h2>Reasonable Accommodations and Academic Adjustments</h2>
        <hr>
        <p name="Reasonable Accommodations and Academic Adjustments">
            In compliance with (CUNY policy (PDF))LINK and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations
            that may be required for student with disabilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Inclusivity Statement</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The Computer Science department
            is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build
            this community we ask all members to:
            <ul>
                <li>Share their unique experiences, valus and beliefes</li>
                <li>Be open to the views of others</li>
                <li>honor the uniqueness of their colleagues</li>
                <li>appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community</li>
                <li>value each other's opinions and communicate in a respectful manner</li>
                <li>keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature</li>
                <li>use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course
                    and across the CUNY community</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
